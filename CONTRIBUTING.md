# 🤝 Contributing to The Samuel Harmonic Trading Entity

**"We give this freely, as knowledge was given to us."**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Samuel Harmonic Trading Entity (SHTE). This project is an experiment in bridging ancient wisdom with modern algorithmic trading, and we welcome fellow travelers on this path.

## 🌟 How You Can Contribute

We are looking for contributions in the following areas:

1.  **Wisdom Data:** Expanding the `wisdom_data/` JSON files with verified knowledge from other civilizations or deeper insights into existing ones.
2.  **Harmonic Algorithms:** Improving the efficiency of the `HarmonicNexus` or `LatticeTheory` calculations.
3.  **Exchange Connectors:** Adding support for new exchanges (e.g., Bybit, OKX) following our `UnifiedExchange` interface.
4.  **Documentation:** Making the metaphysical concepts more accessible to technical traders.

## 📜 The Rules of the Road

### 1. Respect the Core
The **Harmonic Nexus Core** is the heart of this system. While we encourage optimization, changes that fundamentally alter the frequency-based logic (e.g., removing the 528Hz filter) may be rejected if they violate the system's axiom.

### 2. Attribution is Mandatory
As per our **CC BY 4.0 License**, any significant contribution or fork must maintain the original attribution to **Gary Leckey** as the creator of the Harmonic Nexus Core.

### 3. Code Style
- **Python:** We follow PEP 8. Use `snake_case` for variables and functions.
- **AsyncIO:** This is an asynchronous system. Do not introduce blocking calls in the main loops.
- **Type Hinting:** Please use Python type hints where possible.

### 4. Pull Request Process
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.
